Max Meetup Philadelphia is a regular meeting to share ideas and strengthen the connections of the Philadelphia community of Max users, digital artists and musicians. Each meetup will feature workshops, conversations, and open work-shares focusing on art-making, Max, and digital technologies. All experience levels are welcome to attend. Attendees are encouraged to bring their computers if they wish to patch along with the workshops.

This Meetup will feature a demonstration and presentation by Aeroidio (Adam Vidiksis and Sam Wells) on a recent web that integrates machine learning and RNBO generated audio. Working in collaboration with the Little Artists League in Tokyo, Japan, a global-minded art organization devoted to fostering childrenâ€™s creativity through process-oriented art, Aeroidio has developed a web application that transforms camera and gestural data from a mobile device, turning it into an interactive musical instrument that nearly anyone can play.
Following, Aeroidio, Wells will lead a workshop highlighting the exciting, new features in the most recent release of Max, version 8.6.

This event is free and open to the public.
Max Meetup Philadelphia is organized by Sam Wells, a musician, video artist, and Max Certified Trainer based in Philadelphia.
Support provided by Fidget.
